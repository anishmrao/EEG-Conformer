# Cross-subject EEG-Conformer

**This fork of EEG-Conformer has been modified to facilitate cross-subject EEG decoding experiments using multiple datasets.**

### EEG Conformer: Convolutional Transformer for EEG Decoding and Visualization [[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9991178)]
##### Core idea: spatial-temporal conv + pooling + self-attention

## Abstract
![Network Architecture](/visualization/Fig1.png)

- We propose a compact convolutional Transformer, named EEG Conformer, to encapsulate local and global features in a unified EEG classification framework.  
- The convolution module learns the low-level local features throughout the one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers. The self-attention module is straightforwardly connected to extract the global correlation within the local temporal features. Subsequently, the simple classifier module based on fully-connected layers is followed to predict the categories for EEG signals. 
- We also devise a visualization strategy to project the class activation mapping onto the brain topography.
